# mac_encyclopedia

Hi guys. So this project I have  created while learning scrollable widgets.
This project had focused to learing scrollable widgets and creating mock data.
I had used gradient colors and "Sliver app bar".
So I know if design looks strange.
But I had tried to create more informationable encyclopedia about "Mac's".
So I reckon that you can found absorbing information and really cool widgets.
So bye, bye.
